Converts K95 Platinum Elite Keyboard into a heads up display. 

Unneccessary lighting this isn't. I'm not a fan of unneccessary lighting effects.
With careful attention to resource consumption. This program enables this
highly programmable keyboard's leds to do something useful without being distracting
and or resource consuming.

Set the values and run at startup. Then leave it alone. Now the leds do something useful.

Get on with your day.
Less is more.
