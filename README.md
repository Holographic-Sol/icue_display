ICUE Running

Note: This program is not a lighting display effect. It is designed to convert the icue keyboard into a non-distracting,
efficient and non-resource heavy HUD.

Developer notes:
iCUE Display executable is compiled from .py so that module GPUINFO can pipe stdout which is necessary for gpu information.
(This is why the vbs to run quietly will be used because iCUE display is compiled from .py rather than .pyw).

iCUE Display ius designed to be efficient. Threads are killed when iCUE is not running. Threads are killed when function(s)
disabled. Use recommended settings for best efficiency and use.

Shortcuts created are intended for use with iCUEDisplay.exe. Otherwise you must have python and required modules to run
iCUEDisplay.py.
