Frontend is a personal template of mine and has been populated to plug into the backend. GUI is designed to be purely
logical & non-resource heavy to be used as a tool.

This program is not a light display effect. It is designed to convert the icue keyboard into a non-distracting,
efficient and non-resource heavy HUD.

Values are saved to config.dat for memory accross reboots.

Still in development. Plugging the backend into the GUI.
