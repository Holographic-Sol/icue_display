efficient and non-resource heavy HUD.

iCUE Display executable is compiled from .py so that module GPUINFO can pipe stdout which is necessary for gpu information.
(This is why the vbs to run quietly will be used because iCUE display is compiled from .py rather than .pyw).

disabled. Use recommended settings for best efficiency and use.

iCUEDisplay.py.
