iCUE Display

Converts K95 Platinum Elite Keyboard into a heads up display. Providing data and a type of security whereby
one can see what is happening on the system.


Keyboard HUD Displays:
	* HDD DiskBytesPersec For Each Disk Instance & Each Instance is assigned to its own K95 alpha key.
	* CPU Utilization Monitor
	* DRAM Utilization Monitor
	* VRAM Utilization Monitor

GUI:
Designed to be purely logical & non-resource heavy to be used as a tool.

CPU: Percent Utilized.
RAM: Percent Memory Utilized.
VRAM: Percent Memory Utilized.
HDD: Displays which drive letter is being written too.
Network Traffic Sent: Displays Bytes(Red)/KB(Green)/MB(Blue)/GB(L.Blue)/TB(White (For people from the future)) 1(Blue)/10(L.Blue)/100(L.Blue)/1000+(White) F1-F9(Bytes) F10(1/10/100)
Network Traffic Received: Displays Bytes(Red)/KB(Green)/MB(Blue)/GB(L.Blue)/TB(White (For people from the future)) 1(Red)/10(Blue)/100(L.Blue)/1000+(White) 1-9(Bytes) 0(1/10/100)

Enable/Disable: - Turns functions on/off. RGB 1: Colour of RGB on. RGB 2: Colour of RGB off.

Timing: Accepts value between 0.1 and 5. Lower the number, more resources iCUE Display will consume.


Recommended Settings:
Timing: All 1.0 except HDD & Network traffic at 0.1
Exclusive Connection(Exclusive Control): Enabled
RGB 2: 0,0,0 (off) for all.


Install:
iCUEDisplay.exe will create its files and shortcut withing the directory iCUEDisplay is ran. iCUE Display can then be ran
quietly from the created shortcut. To re-install/update to the same directory please delete config.dat, .vbs, .lnl and .bat.
iCUEDisplay is portable and will install itself into its current working directory when executed for the first time.

Requirements:
Python Version: 3.9
OS Version: Windows 10
ICUE Running

Note: This program is not a lighting display effect. It is designed to convert the icue keyboard into a non-distracting,
efficient and non-resource heavy HUD.

Developer notes:
iCUE Display executable is compiled from .py so that module GPUINFO can pipe stdout which is necessary for gpu information.
(This is why the vbs to run quietly will be used because iCUE display is compiled from .py rather than .pyw).

UNDERGOING UPDATE: RGB Values will not update while the current update is in progress (will only update to file). (effiency and id enumeration update).

iCUE Display ius designed to be efficient. Threads are killed when iCUE is not running. Threads are killed when function(s)
disabled. Use recommended settings for best efficiency and use.

Shortcuts created are intended for use with iCUEDisplay.exe. Otherwise you must have python and required modules to run
iCUEDisplay.py.

Observations:
It is intersting that now the monitor can be turned off while still being able to see if a long download or process has completed among other information,
which uses less power and is then more efficient.
